# TIL

Today I learned something that...

* doesn't require a longer writeup
* doesn't belong in its own repo
* isn't something I would use to develop a script

Currently, the collection is composed mostly of system administration tasks.  I hope that this collection evolves to include more data science TIL's.

### [Standing on the shoulders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)
I previously used an amalgam of private gists, text files, and (yes) post-it notes to manage these types of small writeups.  Putting everything into is own repo was inspired by (and copied from)
